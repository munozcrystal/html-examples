        <h1> Web Design </h1>
        <li>
              <p>I'm in Web Design class because I enjoyed the little section we did HTML in Multimedia was a lot of fun. It's such a great and handy skill to have. </p>

           <h1> Skills </h1>
          <li>
              <p>This code skill is handy because if you had to make a website, which is common nowadays, you would know how and not need to spend money. Which is handy for anyone, and any career.</p>

          <li>    
              <p> I have no idea what I want to do, I think I want to become a designer. I don't know which kind, either web, fashion, or graphic. I also want to work at a book publisher. I haven't decided but I still have time.  </p>
